    Legal Disputes
    PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW CLAIMS YOU AND CAPTURE 411 HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.
    In this Legal Disputes section, the term "related third parties" includes your and Capture 411's respective affiliates, subsidiaries, parent companies, predecessors, successors, assigns, as well as your, Capture 411's, and these entities' respective employees and agents.
    You and Capture 411 each agree that any and all claims or disputes at law or equity that has arisen, or may arise, between you and Capture 411 (or any related third parties) that relate in any way to or arise out of this or previous versions of this User Agreement, your use of or access to the Site, the actions of Capture 411 or its agents, or any information old, offered, or purchased through the Site, will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Legal Disputes section.
    
    A. Applicable Law
    You agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by federal law, the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this User Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and Capture 411, except as otherwise stated in this User Agreement.
    
    B. Agreement to Arbitrate
    You and Capture 411 each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen, or may arise, between you and Capture 411 (or any related third parties) that relate in any way to or arise out of this or previous versions of the User Agreement, your use of or access to our Site, the actions of Capture 411 or its agents, or any information sold, offered, or purchased through our Site shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, subject to any exemptions listed in this section.
    The Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") and, to the extent not inconsistent with the FAA, the law of the Commonwealth of Virginia without regard to principles of conflict of laws govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.
        
    1. Exemption - Small Claims Court Claims
    Notwithstanding the parties' agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction and on an individual (non-class) basis only. If a party initiates an arbitration asserting a claim that falls within the jurisdiction of a small claims court, the other party may, in its discretion, require that the arbitration demand be withdrawn and that the claim be filed in small claims court.
    Any dispute about whether a claim falls within any given small claims court's jurisdiction will be resolved by that court, not by an arbitrator. In the event of any such jurisdictional dispute, the arbitration proceeding will remain closed unless and until the small claims court issues a decision that the claim should proceed in arbitration.
        
    2. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief
    YOU AND CAPTURE 411 AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND CAPTURE 411 AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN ANY PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF SOUGHT BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT BE GRANTED TO OR AFFECT OTHER USERS. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim or a particular request for a remedy (such as a request for injunctive relief), then that claim or that remedy request (and only that claim or that remedy request) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court (pursuant to Section 18.C below), subject to your and Capture 411's right to appeal the court's decision. All other claims will be arbitrated.
        
    3. Arbitration Procedures
    Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individualized basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator will apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 2 of this Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief"), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide as set forth under Section 18.C below.
    The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules and the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules, and the AAA's International Centre for Dispute Resolution Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. Absent mutual written agreement of the parties, the AAA shall decide which AAA rules apply to the arbitration. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org and www.icdr.org. In the event that the AAA is unavailable to administer the arbitration, another administrator will be selected by the parties or, if the parties cannot reach agreement, the court (pursuant to Section 18.C below) shall select the administrator.
    A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a valid Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to Capture 411 must be sent to Capture 411 LLC, P.O. Box 1074, Dumfries, Virginia 22026-9998. Capture 411 will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your Capture 411 account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. To be valid, you must personally sign the Notice and include a description of the nature and basis of the claims you are asserting, the specific relief sought, and the email address and phone number associated with your account.
    If you and Capture 411 are unable to resolve the claims described in a valid Notice within 30 days after Capture 411 receives that Notice, you or Capture 411 may initiate arbitration or small claims proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's Site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to Capture 411 at the following address: Capture 411 LLC, P.O. Box 1074, Dumfries, Virginia 22026-9998, 7. In the event Capture 411 initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your Capture 411 account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. Any settlement offer made by you or Capture 411 shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.
    If you are a resident of the United States, then the arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If you are not a resident of the United States, then the arbitration hearing will be held in the Commonwealth of Virginia, United States, or another mutually agreed location. Where no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000, the dispute shall be resolved by the submission of documents only, subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or Capture 411 may attend remotely, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. The language of the arbitration will be English.
    The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but shall be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Capture 411 user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
        
    4. Costs of Arbitration
    Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If you complied with the Notice of Dispute procedures of Section 3 of this Agreement ("Arbitration Procedures"), and the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, Capture 411 will pay all administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by Capture 411 should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and Capture 411 will make arrangements to pay administration and arbitrator fees directly to the AAA. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse Capture 411 for all fees associated with the arbitration that have been paid by Capture 411 on your behalf that you otherwise would have been obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.
        
    5. Severability
    With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 2 of this Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief"), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.
        
    6. Opt-Out Procedure
    IF YOU ARE A NEW USER OF OUR SITE, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ("OPT-OUT") BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE ("OPT-OUT NOTICE"). THE OPT-OUT NOTICE MUST BE POSTMARKED NO LATER THAN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THE USER AGREEMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME. YOU MUST MAIL THE OPT-OUT NOTICE TO CAPTURE 411 LLC, P.O. Box 1074, Dumfries, Virginia 22026-9998. 
    You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate. If you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of this User Agreement and its Legal Disputes section will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.
        
    7. Future Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate
    Notwithstanding any provision in the User Agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this Agreement to Arbitrate, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Capture 411 prior to the effective date of the amendment. The amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and Capture 411. We will notify you of amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate by posting the amended terms on www.Capture 411.com at least 30 days before the effective date of the amendments and by providing notice through the Capture 411 Message Center and/or by email. If you do not agree to these amended terms, you may close your account within the 30-day period and you will not be bound by the amended terms.
    
    C. Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes
    If the Agreement to Arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, either as a result of your decision to opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate or as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you agree that any claim or dispute between you and Capture 411 will be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Fairfax, Virginia. You and Capture 411 agree to submit exclusively to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Fairfax, Virginia for the purpose of litigating all such claims, disputes, or matters.
